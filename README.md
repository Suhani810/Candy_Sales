# Candy_Sales
🚀 Just wrapped up a Python Data Analysis Project using a dataset on Candy Sales 📊🍬 In this project, I explored trends and patterns in candy sales data using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. I cleaned and analyzed the data, visualized key metrics like product-wise sales, monthly trend to help optimize sales strategies.
